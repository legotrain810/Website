    <h2>About Me</h2>
   <p>
  I am 15 years old and currently attending Dayspring Academy in New Port Richey, Florida. I was born and raised in the vibrant city of Tampa, also in Florida. Growing up in this diverse and dynamic state has been an incredible journey, and I'm proud to call it my home.
</p>
<p>
  My passion for technology and coding has been a driving force in my life. At a young age, I delved into the world of programming and software development, and I've never looked back. One of my proudest achievements is creating a project called "Can You Win Games," where I explore the art of game development and challenge myself to craft engaging and entertaining experiences.
</p>
<p>
  Beyond the digital realm, I have a love for physical challenges as well. I'm an enthusiastic participant in cross country (XC) running. I started my XC journey when I was just 13, and it has been an incredible journey of endurance, self-discipline, and personal growth. Running through the scenic landscapes of Florida has allowed me to connect with nature and push my limits.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to my academic and athletic pursuits, I'm also proud to hold the rank of Eagle in the Boy Scouts of America. Achieving this prestigious rank has taught me valuable leadership, teamwork, and outdoor skills. It's a testament to my dedication to personal growth and community service.
